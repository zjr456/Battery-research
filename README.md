# Battery-research
Simscape was used to model the physical battery, design the structure of the cell, the module and the pack, and study and analyze the charging and discharging, as well as the health of the battery under different temperature conditions    使用simscape进行物理电池建模，自主设计电芯（cell）电池模块（module）以及电池包（pack）结构,研究分析充电和放电以及电池的健康在不同温度等条件下的情况
